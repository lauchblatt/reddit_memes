Did you know that at Cornell
University they have an incredible
piece of scientific equipment
known as the tunneling electron
microscope? Now, this microscope
is so powerful that by firing
electrons you can actually see
images of the atom, the
infinitesimally minute building
blocks of our universe. If I were
using that microscope right now, I
still wouldn't be able to locate my
interest in your problem.

How can I test if my son is gay?
I am worried my son might be gay. I want to get him checked. Isn't is possible to get a
hormone check? A vocal cord check? Can't a doctor indicate if he is gay or not? My
son has almost no muscles and narrow shoulders. He also has blue eyes. He talks in
a very high voice and while he sings he sounds like a castrato. He tells me his voice is
Gary
called tenor.

There's a really simple test you can do at home.

Get some vinegar, get some baking soda. Then make a big clay volcano. Then while
this is erupting, if your son is too busy sucking a dick, hes gay.

We honestly do not remember EA ever having
the community backlash that led us to Star
Wars Battlefront 2 being received like this.
This has encouraged us to address other
things about our company. We have loved
and had romantic encounters with men
throughout our life, and we now choose to
live as a gay company.

Went to Starbucks b/c Idk how to

Everyone looks like zombies & I'm
spacing out myself.
All of a sudden this guy stands next
to me and goes, ""this is crazy!""
Then grabs my hand to hold it. We
both looked down at & looked up.
Him: you're not my wife.
Me: nope.
(Girl behind us): You're holding the
wrong hand, honey.
Him: You sure?
Me: We're sure.
Him: I feel committed to finishing
this Starbucks experience w/ you

Me: I'm not paying.
Him: oh nvm, let me go back to my
wife.
Wife: I'm not paying either!
(Guy in front of us): Come hold my

So l finally landed a job as a Wal-Mart greeter, which is
a good find for many retirees, unfortunately I lasted less
than a day.
How
may I
help
you?
About two hours into my first day on the job a very loud,
unattractive, mean-acting woman walked into the store
with her two kids, yelling obscenities at them all the way
through the entrance. Per my greeter training manual I
said pleasantly, ""Good morning and welcome to Wal-
Mart."" ""Nice children you have there. Are they twins?""
The ugly woman stopped yelling long enough to say,
""Hell no, they ain't twins. The oldest one is 9, and the
other one is 7. Why the hell would you think they're
twins? Are you blind, or just stupid?""
So I replied, ""I'm neither blind nor stupid, madam. I just
couldn't believe someone slept with you twice. Have a
good day and thank you for shopping at Wal-Mart.""
My supervisor said I probably wasn't cut out for this line
of work.

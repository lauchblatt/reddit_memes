Some dogs are doggos, some are puppers,
and others may even be pupperinos. There are
corgos and clouds, fluffers and floofs, woofers
and boofers. The chunky ones are thicc, and the
thin ones are long bois. When they stick out their
tongues, they're doing a mlem, a blep, a blop.
They bork. They boof. Once in a while they do
each other a frighten.

the guy's skull and headbutted him REAL hard."" The witness continued on to
say, ""Then Kringle got on top of him and just started pummeling him. He was
laughing and screaming 'Ho! Hol Ho! Motherfucker!

old boy was at the center of a
NYC courtroom drama
yesterday when he challenged
a court ruling over who should
have custody of him. The boy
has a history of being beaten by
his parents and the judge
initially awarded custody to his
aunt, in keeping with child
custody law and regulation
requiring that family unity be
maintained to the highest
degree possible. The boy
surprised the court when he
proclaimed that his aunt beat
him just like his parents and he
refused to live with her. When
the judge then suggested that
he live with his grandparents,
the boy cried and said that they
also beat him. Now learning
that violence was apparently a
way of life for the family, the
judge took the unprecedented
step of allowing the boy to
propose who should have
custody of him. After conferring
with the child welfare officials,
the judge granted temporary
custody to the New York Giants,
whom the boy firmly believes
are not capable of beating
anyone.

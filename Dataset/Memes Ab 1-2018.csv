You know how when you're a fast
walker and the guy ahead of you is
fast too but only 90% as fast as you,
so you MUST pass him, but to pass
him you have to walk comically faster
than your normal speed, or else you'll
be in his personal space too long as
you pass? That's annoying.

About JD
I can lift a fully-grown horse above my head, and I can
hold my breath for ten minutes. To settle a wager, I
once ate a pound of P.B. Fouke's strongest badger
poison and then ran a mile in the nude. I cannot feel
pain, and I can see for two miles unaided by a lens. No
man can kill me. I have beaten a man of every race in
formal combat, including a Turk, a Pygmy Negro Man
and a rare Deepwater Jew. A medical doctor and two
priests have written and signed a document confirming
that I have no soul.

contains about 31,000,000 calories
via reddit.com
personsonable
human daily caloric requirement is 1500 to 2500
depending on the person
1 gallon of gasoline contains enough calories
to satisfy that requirement for 12400 to 20600

technology have proven equally exaggerated. Those apprehensive
about computer-assisted tutoring or online instruction would do
well to keep in mind that such concerns have greeted almost any
new learning tool. Dave Thornburg and David Dwyer, for instance,
offer
up a list of past complaints in their book Rethinking Education
in the Age of Technology: The Digital Revolution and Schooling in
America. From today's vantage point, some of the concerns make
for amusing reading:
From a principal's publication, 1815: ""Students today depend
on paper too much. They don't know how to write on a slate
without getting chalk dust all over themselves. They can't clean
a slate properly. What will they do when they run out of paper?""

his penis and pointed it at Uncie Vernoin
He looked up. Riddle was still watching him twirling Harry's penis between his

Harry took the penis. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the

One 18 inch Pizza has more 'Pizza' than
two 12 inch Pizzas.
18 inch Pizza = 7(18/2)2
= 254in.
Two 12 inch Pizzas = 27(12/2)

I'm so confused as to what I'm supposed to find upsetting about this. Like I get it
looks very industrial, but why is that bad? Did this person used to think that cans

fully prepared, non-perishable meals in convenient containers for 99 cents at
your local winn Dixie somehow insufficiently fantastic for you?

""You never know true beauty until you see Earth from space, or
true terror until you hear someone knocking on the space
station door from outside. You look through the porthole and
see an astronaut, but all your crew is inside and accounted for.
You use the comm to ask who it is and he says he's Ramirez
returning from a repair mission, but Ramirez is sitting right next
to you in the command module and he's just as confused as
you are. When you tell the guy this over the radio he starts
banging on the door louder and harder, begging you to let him
in, saying he's the real Ramirez. Meanwhile, the Ramirez
inside with you is pleading to keep the airlock shut. It really
puts life on Earth into perspective.""

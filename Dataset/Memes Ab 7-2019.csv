I'd start some sort of tree planting organisation, based
of perhaps money=trees. I would then scatter the bodies
under these trees. Public focus would be on the trees and
no one would dig up a tree because of the public backlash,
over the years the trees would get bigger fully covering
the bodies hiding them forever and I would be a hero for
planting millions of trees

for amusing reading:
From a principal's publication, 1815: ""Students today depend
on paper too much. They don't know how to write on a slate
without getting chalk dust all over themselves. They can't clean
a slate properly. What will they do when they run out of paper?""

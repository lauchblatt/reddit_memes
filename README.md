# Memes of r\memes

This is a repository to store material for a research project exploring memes from the platform <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/">r\memes</a>, the subreddit for meme on Reddit, beginning from 2013.

Due to size limitations, you can find the image-files to the memes hosted on an university server here: <a href="https://files.mi.ur.de/d/59251d84b86c48cdbf17/">link</a> (The download might take some time).

We are currently in the process of preparing more data, you currently find metadata in form of csv (folder: Dataset) and json (folder: json), analysis 
results for sentiment analysis (folder: Sentiment), LIWC-analysis (folder: LIWC) and wordclouds (folder: Wordclouds).
